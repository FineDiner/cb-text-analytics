## Official Cash Rate

- The Reserve Bank uses monetary policy to maintain price stability as defined in the Policy Targets Agreement (PTA). The current PTA requires the Bank to keep inflation between 1 and 3 percent on average over the medium term, with a focus on keeping future average inflation near the 2 percent target midpoint. The Bank implements monetary policy by setting the Official Cash Rate (OCR), which is reviewed eight times a year.
